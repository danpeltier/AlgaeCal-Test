# AlgaeCal-Test

This project is my solution to the Test provided by AlgaeCal Inc as an indication of my qualifications for the Front End Developer position currently being offered.

## Getting Started

In order to deploy this project, you must save the app folder to a development (localhost) or web server.

### Prerequisites

Most features will work fine without one, but the video will not show unless the site is saved to a server.

### Installing

Either save to a new folder in the htdocs folder for XAMPP (or equivalent for other development server environments), or upload to a new folder on your own web server via FTP.

Default for MAC:

```
Save to Applications -> XAMPP -> htdocs -> new-folder
```

Default for Windows:

```
Save to C:\Program Files\xampp
```

In either case, you can view the site at:

```
http://localhost/new-folder
```
